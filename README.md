# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

Higher-Order Components (HOCs) in React are advanced patterns used to reuse component logic. An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component, essentially enhancing the original component with additional features or data.

Writing a Higher-Order Component
Here's a simple step-by-step guide:

Create the HOC Function: This function will accept a component as an argument.

Return a New Component: Inside this function, return a new component that wraps the original component.

Pass Props: You can pass props to the wrapped component and add any additional props or logic as needed.
